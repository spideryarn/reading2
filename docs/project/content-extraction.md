# Content extraction (readability)

Strips a rich HTML page (article/blog post) down to the main content — drops nav, ads, sidebars, comments — using [Mozilla Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) (the Firefox Reader View algorithm).

- Script: `src/extract.ts`
- Run: `npm run extract -- <url> [outFile]` (defaults to `output/article.html`)
- Output: a standalone, styled HTML file (not Markdown — kept as HTML to avoid losing structure/links/images)
- Dependencies: `@mozilla/readability` + `jsdom` (parses HTML into a DOM, since Node has none natively)
- Sample run: `output/noema-mythology-of-conscious-ai.html`, extracted from https://www.noemamag.com/the-mythology-of-conscious-ai/

For background on why Readability was chosen over alternatives (trafilatura, defuddle, Diffbot, Jina Reader, LLM-based extraction, etc.), see the research discussion earlier in this project's chat history — no separate write-up exists yet.

## Where this sits

This is **stage 2** of the pipeline — see [architecture.md § Pipeline](architecture.md#pipeline).
It feeds the block-splitting stage that assigns the stable ids everything else anchors to
([AGENTS.md § The one contract that matters](../../AGENTS.md#the-one-contract-that-matters)), which
in turn feeds the deeply-nested table of contents and the
[granularity-zoom tree](granularity-zoom.md#the-tree) — one structure, not two.

Two questions that used to land on this stage were settled on 2026-08-24, both away from it:
id assignment belongs to **stage 3**, not extraction, and ids are random so they survive
re-extraction ([block-ids.md](block-ids.md)); a block is the *finest* unit a reader takes in as one
thing ([architecture.md § What a block is](architecture.md#what-a-block-is)).

What this stage still owes stage 3: sanitized HTML whose element structure is stable run-to-run.
Ids are preserved by matching on the `spya-` attribute already in the document, so extraction must
not strip unrecognised `id` attributes — doing so would re-mint every id and orphan every note.

The standalone styled HTML output is a debug view; once the server exists
([architecture.md § Server and client](architecture.md#server-and-client)), the durable artefacts are
`article.html` + `meta.json` under `data/<slug>/`.

Why any of this exists at all: [vision.md](vision.md).

## Prior art

The previous version of Spideryarn ran a Readability-based extraction path in production and wrote
down what went wrong with it. See
[original-version.md](original-version.md#things-it-built-that-were-also-building) for the pointers.
