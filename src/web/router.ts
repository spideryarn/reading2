/**
 * The pages, and which one you are on is the path.
 *
 * Greg, 2026-08-25:
 *
 * > have a homepage that enables us to browse past documents, and then if I
 * > click on one of the documents, it takes us to this interface that we've been
 * > building using a slug of the URL … So it might be `/read/[slug]/`
 *
 * So: `/` is the library, `/read/<slug>` is the reading view, and the slug is
 * part of the address rather than a `?slug=` parameter. Everything *else* stays
 * in the query string — see params.ts. The division is: **the path says which
 * article, the query says how you are looking at it.** A pasted link carries
 * both.
 *
 * ## The third segment
 *
 * An article now has three views, and which one is a third path segment:
 * `/read/<slug>` is the reading view, `/read/<slug>/metadata` is everything we
 * know about it (docs/plans/metadata-page.md), `/read/<slug>/tweets` is the
 * article as a numbered thread (docs/plans/tweet-thread-page.md). They are the
 * same article seen differently, so they are the same route with a `view`
 * rather than three routes.
 *
 * ## Why this is fifty lines and not react-router
 *
 * There are two routes and one parameter. React Router would bring a provider,
 * a route table and its own history abstraction to express that, and would then
 * sit between us and `history` — which matters here, because nuqs wants to see
 * every history write. Two libraries owning navigation is the kind of
 * arrangement that works until the day it doesn't.
 *
 * Calling `history.pushState` ourselves means nuqs sees our navigations exactly
 * as it sees its own — **but only because main.tsx calls
 * `enableHistorySync()`.** That is worth spelling out, because this paragraph
 * used to assert the patching as a property of nuqs and it is not: it is opt-in
 * and nothing had opted in, so `navigate()` was invisible to every
 * `useQueryState` in the app. The argument for hand-rolling the router depends
 * on that one call; if it ever goes, this file's whole justification goes with
 * it. main.tsx has the mechanism and the docstring that talks you out of it.
 *
 * This file used to say *"revisit if a third route arrives with nested
 * layouts"*, and one has: the metadata page is a page of its own that shares
 * the article fetch and the bottom bar with the reading view. It was weighed
 * rather than waved through — the shared shell is one branch in `ArticlePage`
 * (App.tsx) and one extra alternation in the regex below, which is still far
 * less than a router. **The next person to add a route should re-read this
 * paragraph rather than assume the question stays settled.** The thing to watch
 * for is a view that needs its own nested sub-routes, or a fourth segment.
