/**
 * The wire shape, in one place, so the poll and the stream cannot disagree.
 *
 * This is a separate module for one reason: `server.ts` binds ports at import
 * time, so anything that lives there cannot be tested without a listening
 * socket. That is the same accident `page.ts` caused — importing one helper
 * from a test bound 8787 and the suite went from 4s to 19s — and it matters
 * more here, because this payload now has THREE consumers that must agree
 * about it: the React client, an SSE subscriber, and the Overseer daemon
 * (`tools/overseer/`, another session) which folds these snapshots into a
 * history of what the fleet did.
 *
 * THE EMPTY-BUT-HONEST CASE IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. Before the first
 * collection there is no snapshot, and something has to be sent to a poll that
 * arrives in that window. `rows: []` with `collectedAt: null` is that
 * something, and the null is the whole message: **an empty `rows` is only ever
 * a claim about the box when `collectedAt` is non-null.** Read them separately
 * and a freshly restarted dashboard says "no sessions are running" about a box
 * with thirty-six of them — which is the reading least likely to make anyone
 * look, and the one a history would record as thirty-six sessions vanishing at
 * once. Every consumer must branch on `collectedAt` before it believes `rows`.
